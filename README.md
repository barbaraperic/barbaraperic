I am a product-minded developer who loves to explore ideas around [malleable](https://www.inkandswitch.com/embark/) software.

Currently exploring the local-first ethos.

I also love to teach people how to code, particularly when it come to the weird parts of JavaScript.

👩‍🍳 React, Next.js, Typescript, XState
