### Hi, I'm Barbara ðŸ‘‹

 I'm a product-minded frontend developer, and full-time adventure seeker. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with React, Typescript, Tailwind and Next.js

ðŸ‘¯ Always looking to collaborate on fun projects

ðŸ“« Best to reach me on b.peric10@gmail.com

âš¡ Fun fact: I have a deep passion for endurance sports, such as embarking on cycling journeys from Paris to London, conquering a 500km cycling expedition through Croatia, and most recently, completing a 5km open water swim competition.


Thanks for visiting and I'd love to connect!
